# Stingray Automation

This repository is used to store items that are useful where non-interactive
deployment of Stingray Traffic Manager is required.  There are currently only
examples intended for use with a **bash** interpreter.

**Note:** This code is intended only as an example.  It will not be supported by
Riverbed's technical support team.
